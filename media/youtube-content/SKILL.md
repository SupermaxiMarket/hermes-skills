# YouTube Content Tool

## When to use

Use when the user shares a YouTube URL or video link, asks to summarize a video, requests a transcript, or wants to extract and reformat content from any YouTube video. Transforms transcripts into structured content (chapters, summaries, threads, blog posts).
**Language Preference**: If the user communicates in French, always respond in French. If the user uses another language, respond in that language.

Extract transcripts from YouTube videos and convert them into useful formats.

## Setup

```bash
pip install youtube-transcript-api
```

## Helper Script

`SKILL_DIR` is the directory containing this SKILL.md file. The script accepts any standard YouTube URL format, short links (youtu.be), shorts, embeds, live links, or a raw 11-character video ID.

```bash
# JSON output with metadata
python3 SKILL_DIR/scripts/fetch_transcript.py "https://youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID"

# Plain text (good for piping into further processing)
python3 SKILL_DIR/scripts/fetch_transcript.py "URL" --text-only

# With timestamps
python3 SKILL_DIR/scripts/fetch_transcript.py "URL" --timestamps

# Specific language with fallback chain
python3 SKILL_DIR/scripts/fetch_transcript.py "URL" --language tr,en
```

## Output Formats

After fetching the transcript, format it based on what the user asks for:

- **Chapters**: Group by topic shifts, output timestamped chapter list
- **Summary**: Concise 5-10 sentence overview of the entire video
- **Chapter summaries**: Chapters with a short paragraph summary for each
- **Thread**: Twitter/X thread format — numbered posts, each under 280 chars
- **Blog post**: Full article with title, sections, and key takeaways
- **Quotes**: Notable quotes with timestamps

### Example — Chapters Output

```
00:00 Introduction — host opens with the problem statement
03:45 Background — prior work and why existing solutions fall short
12:20 Core method — walkthrough of the proposed approach
24:10 Results — benchmark comparisons and key takeaways
31:55 Q&A — audience questions on scalability and next steps
```

## Workflow

1. **Fetch** the transcript using the helper script with `--text-only --timestamps`.
2. **Validate**: confirm the output is non-empty and in the expected language. If empty, retry without `--language` to get any available transcript. If still empty, tell the user the video likely has transcripts disabled.
3. **Chunk if needed**: if the transcript exceeds ~50K characters, split into overlapping chunks (~40K with 2K overlap) and summarize each chunk before merging.
4. **Transform** into the requested output format. If the user did not specify a format, default to a summary.
5. **Verify**: re-read the transformed output to check for coherence, correct timestamps, and completeness before presenting.

## Error Handling

- **Transcript disabled**: tell the user; suggest they check if subtitles are available on the video page.
- **Private/unavailable video**: relay the error and ask the user to verify the URL.
- **No matching language**: retry without `--language` to fetch any available transcript, then note the actual language to the user.
- **Dependency missing**: run `pip install youtube-transcript-api`; if you encounter an externally-managed environment error, add `--break-system-packages` or use a virtual environment.

## Troubleshooting

If the installation kit program stops unexpectedly during setup or execution, consider the following steps:

- **Check logs**: Look for error messages in the terminal or log files; they often indicate missing dependencies or permission issues.
- **Re‑run with verbose output**: Many installers have a `--verbose` or `-v` flag that shows each step.
- **Verify prerequisites**: Ensure required tools (e.g., Java, Android SDK, Node.js) are installed and their versions match the project's requirements.
- **Clean and rebuild**: Delete any build/cache directories (`rm -rf build/ node_modules/ .gradle/`) and run the installation from scratch.
- **Run as administrator / with sudo**: On Windows/macOS/Linux, insufficient privileges can cause silent failures.
- **Consult the documentation**: Refer to the official README or wiki for known issues and workarounds.

After applying these steps, retry the installation. If the problem persists, share the relevant log excerpt for further diagnosis.
